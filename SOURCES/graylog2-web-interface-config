# Secret key
# ~~~~~
# The secret key is used to secure cryptographics functions. Set this to a long and randomly generated string.
# If you deploy your application to several instances be sure to use the same key!
# Generate for example with: pwgen -s 96
application.secret=""

# Web interface timezone
# Graylog2 stores all timestamps in UTC. To properly display times, set the default timezone of the interface.
# If you leave this out, Graylog2 will pick your system default as the timezone. Usually you will want to configure it explicitly.
timezone="Europe/Moscow"

# Message field limit
# Your web interface can cause high load in your browser when you have a lot of different message fields. The default
# limit of message fields is 100. Set it to 0 if you always want to get all fields. They are for example used in the
# search result sidebar or for autocompletion of field names.
field_list_limit=100

# You usually do not want to change this.
application.global=lib.Global
